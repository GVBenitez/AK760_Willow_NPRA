This region experiences extreme temperature variations, with brutally cold winters where average temperatures often plummet below -15°F, and brief, cool summers barely reaching 50°F in July. The average annual temperature ranges from 8 to 14°F. The average freeze-free period is fewer than 5 days to 20 days. Freezing temperatures can occur in any month. Figure 2.1: This is NRCS Snotel data from https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/site?sitenum=1177 Despite its frigid nature, the arctic coastal plain receives surprisingly little precipitation, typically ranging from 6-10 inches annually. Most of this falls as snow, blanketing the landscape for much of the year. The average annual snowfall is about 50 to 100 centimeters. The low precipitation, coupled with minimal evaporation rates due to the cold, creates a unique hydrologic balance that doesn’t quite fit the traditional definition of a desert. Figure 2.2: This is NRCS Snotel data from https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/site?sitenum=1177 2.2 Growing Season One of the most striking features of this climate is the dramatic swing in daylight hours throughout the year. Summers bring the phenomenon of the midnight sun, with 24 hours of continuous daylight, while winters plunge the region into weeks of polar night. This extreme light regime profoundly impacts biological rhythms and human activities alike. The coastal plain is also known for its windy conditions, with strong easterly winds being common. These winds, combined with the already frigid temperatures, can create dangerously low wind chill factors. The growing season in the Arctic Coastal Plain is exceptionally brief, usually lasting only 50-60 days. This short window of relatively warmer temperatures and thawed ground surface supports a unique but fragile tundra ecosystem. Coastal areas are further influenced by sea ice, which is typically present for 8-9 months of the year, affecting local weather patterns and wildlife migrations. Figure 2.3: This is NRCS SNOTEL data from https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/view Underlying this harsh surface climate is a layer of continuous permafrost, a defining characteristic of the region. The active layer, which thaws seasonally, is typically shallow, extending only 30-50 cm (12-20 inches) deep. This frozen ground significantly influences the area’s ecology and presents unique challenges for construction and resource extraction. 2.3 Geomorphology The Arctic Coastal Plain is characterized by extremely low relief, with elevations ranging from approximately 4 meters to 94 meters and a mean elevation of 33 meters above sea level. This remarkably flat terrain facilitates the development of several distinctive periglacial and aeolian landforms: Figure 2.4: This is IFSAR data from https://elevation.alaska.gov/ Longitudinal Dunes: Ancient sand dune systems oriented parallel to prevailing wind directions Formed during past climatic conditions when the region was less vegetated Now mostly stabilized by tundra vegetation but still influence modern topography Oriented Lakes (Thermokarst Lakes): Distinctive oval-shaped lakes aligned perpendicular to prevailing summer winds Formation controlled by differential erosion and thaw along lake margins Typically 2-4 meters deep with long axes oriented 10-15 degrees west of true north Result from permafrost thaw and wind-driven circulation patterns Highly Sinuous River Channels: Extremely meandering channels due to the very low gradient coastal plain Channels often confined by ice-rich permafrost banks Seasonal flow regimes heavily influenced by spring breakup events Ice Wedge Polygons: Extensive polygonal ground patterns formed by thermal contraction cracking Create distinctive micro-topography across the plain Range from low-centered to high-centered depending on degradation state Typically 10-30 meters in diameter Beaded Streams: Distinctive “string of beads” appearance from connected pools Formed where channels intersect ice wedges Pools typically 2-3 meters deep with connecting channels Important habitat for fish and waterbirds This landscape represents a complex interaction between periglacial, fluvial, and aeolian processes operating on extremely ice-rich permafrost terrain. The low relief makes the region particularly sensitive to climate change, with thermokarst processes actively modifying the surface morphology.
