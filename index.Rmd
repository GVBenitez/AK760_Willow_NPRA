## Usage 

This survey was a cooperative effort of the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). NRCS was responsible for survey design and methodology, data collection and analysis, and this report. Fieldwork was completed in July and August of ’21, ’23, and ‘24. Soil names and descriptions were approved in 2024. Unless indicated otherwise, maps and supporting documentation in this report refer to conditions in the survey area in 2024.

Maps in this report may be copied without permission. However, enlargement of these maps could cause misunderstanding of the detail of mapping. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils and vegetation that could gave been shown at a larger scale.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
